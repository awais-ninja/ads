## Why SEO Still Matters in 2025

Despite AI-generated content and zero-click search changes, 90% of online journeys still begin with a search engine. Ranking well in Google ensures:

- More organic traffic
- Higher trust from users
- Lower cost-per-acquisition compared to paid ads

Google now emphasizes **experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trust (E-E-A-T)** in every piece of content.

## Optimize for Page Experience

Google officially considers page experience signals as part of their ranking systems.

### Key Factors:

- **Core Web Vitals** (Loading speed, Interactivity, Visual stability)
- **Mobile-friendliness**
- **HTTPS**
- **No intrusive interstitials**

ðŸ›  Use [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) and fix:

- Large image files
- Render-blocking JavaScript
- Poor mobile layouts

## Use Structured Data for Better Visibility

Structured data helps Google understand your content and display it in rich results.

Popular schema types include:

- `Article`
- `FAQPage`
- `Product`
- `BreadcrumbList`

ðŸ§  Implement [JSON-LD](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data) for blog posts:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BlogPosting",
  "headline": "Mastering SEO in 2025: A Practical Guide",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Awais Ahmad"
  },
  "datePublished": "2025-08-02"
}
```
