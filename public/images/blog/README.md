# Blog Images

This directory should contain images for blog posts. For the current blog posts, you'll need to add the following images:

1. `website-design-trends-2024.jpg` - Image for "Top Website Design Trends for 2024"
2. `seo-strategies-small-business.jpg` - Image for "Essential SEO Strategies for Small UK Businesses"
3. `choosing-right-website-platform.jpg` - Image for "How to Choose the Right Website Platform"
4. `email-marketing-tips-uk-businesses.jpg` - Image for "Email Marketing Tips That Actually Work"

## Image Requirements:

- Recommended size: 1200x630 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Format: JPG or PNG
- File size: Under 500KB for optimal loading
- Content: Relevant to the blog post topic
- Style: Professional, modern, and consistent with your brand

## Temporary Solution:

Until you add the actual images, you can use placeholder images from services like:

- https://picsum.photos/1200/630
- https://placeholder.com/1200x630
- Or create your own images using tools like Canva, Figma, or Photoshop
