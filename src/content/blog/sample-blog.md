## 🧠 What Is Web Hosting?

**Web hosting** is the service that allows you to publish your website on the internet. It’s where all your website files — like text, images, and code — are stored and accessed by visitors through a web browser.

When someone types your website address (like `www.awaisdigitalservices.co.uk`), their browser connects to your **web hosting provider's server**, which sends the content to their screen.

Think of it like this:

> **Your domain name** = Your address  
> **Your web hosting** = Your house  
> **Your website content** = Your furniture

Without hosting, your domain name has no home — and visitors won’t see anything.

Web hosting is essential for any website to:

- Stay **online and accessible 24/7**
- Load fast and reliably
- Keep visitor data **secure**
- Allow you to set up custom email (like `hello@yourdomain.com`)
- Enable content management systems like **WordPress**, **Shopify**, or **Wix**

## 🔐 What Is SSL and Why Is It Important?

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** encrypts data sent between your website and users. It’s essential for:

- Building trust (shows a padlock 🔒 in the browser)
- Securing data (like contact forms or logins)
- Ranking better on Google (SSL is a ranking factor)

Most hosting providers now include SSL for free. If yours doesn’t — switch!

## 💡 How to Choose the Best Web Hosting for Your Business

When picking a hosting plan, consider:

- **Speed & uptime** (look for 99.9% uptime guarantees)
- **Free SSL certificate** (non-negotiable)
- **Support** (24/7 live chat or phone support)
- **Scalability** (can you upgrade as you grow?)
- **Email services** (custom emails like `info@yourdomain.com`)

## 🔎 Common FAQs About Web Hosting

### ❓ Is web hosting the same as a domain?

No — a **domain** is your website’s address (e.g., `yourname.co.uk`), while **hosting** is where your site lives.

### ❓ Can I host a website for free?

There are free hosting options, but they often come with:

- Ads
- Slow speeds
- No support
- Limited features

For a serious business, go for reliable paid hosting.

### ❓ Do I need web hosting for WordPress?

Yes — unless you’re using **WordPress.com**, you’ll need to buy hosting to install **WordPress.org**.
