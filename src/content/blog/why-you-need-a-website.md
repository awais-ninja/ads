## Why You Need a Website in 2025

Gone are the days when social media profiles or word-of-mouth alone could grow a business. Today’s customers expect businesses to be searchable and reliable — and that starts with a website.

Having a professional website tells potential customers that you’re legitimate, transparent, and accessible.

🔍 **Key trust signals include:**

If people can’t find you online, they might assume your business doesn’t exist — or worse, that it’s not trustworthy.

🌐 A strong online presence helps you:

- Show up on Google Search and Maps
- Connect with customers beyond your local area
- Share your brand story, mission, and values

Unlike social media, **you own your website**. You're not at the mercy of changing algorithms or platform shutdowns.
